# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm). This app was created as a project for the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp. It shows the current date near the top and colors the time blocks based on if it is past that hour of the day, if it is currently that hour, or that hour is yet to come.   

This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It also uses the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time.
